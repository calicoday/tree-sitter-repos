- relate tree-sitter-repos to adding makings to tree-sitter, pass MAKINGS_DIR???
- version_roster.json
- clarify clone/make_lang when they ARE versioned, also active???
- README

readme tidbits:
- if /usr/local/lib, include (or equiv) don't exist, likely need sudo to create and I don't know how to prompt that from the Makefile (fails silently, I think)


Like the other one, it's in a scrappier state than I'd like for a release but it's taken a hard couple of months and I've lost perspective on 'ready enough'. Fixes are ongoing, in any case.
