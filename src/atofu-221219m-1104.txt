x- untagged..
- -snap for langs
x- query github for latest tag/commit info, x langs, - runtimes
- list *LANGUAGE_VERSION for langs, runtimes
x- mv Make scripts to Makings/
- fix or list langs with weird dir structures


note:
- no way currently to make with specific commit already cloned, .: no snapshot support
- repos that are tagged are cloned headless -- generally, this isn't meant for versions/forks in dev
- currently, langs only pull the latest tag or HEAD (snap)
- to determine which langs have what src/ structure, we need to download all and make a list one time
